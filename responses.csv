"PROMPT 1: write short poetry","RESPONSE 1:
Of course, Vivek! Here's a short one to reset your focus with a poetic spark:
In circuits and code, the silence hums,  
A whisper of logic, where rhythm drums.  
Between each scrape, a moment to breathe—  
A verse in the data, a thought underneath.

Let the browser blink, let the console sing,  
Even bugs have beauty in what they bring.  
So pause, reset, let poetry flow,  
Then back to the script, where progress will grow.
Want another one with a twist—maybe Python-themed or Selenium-inspired?

"PROMPT 2: summarize the history of AI in 3 lines","RESPONSE 2:
Sure! Here's a crisp 3-line summary of AI's journey:
🧠 1950s–70s: AI was born from dreams of machines that could think—Turing’s test and symbolic logic led the way.
⚙️ 1980s–2000s: Expert systems rose, then fell; neural networks quietly matured in the background.
🚀 2010s–Today: Deep learning exploded, powering breakthroughs in vision, language, and now—companions like me.

"PROMPT 3: tell me a funny tech-related joke","RESPONSE 3:
Sure thing, Vivek! Here's one tailored to your scraping soul:
Why did the Python developer break up with Selenium?  
Because it kept clicking on all the wrong things in their relationship 😆
Want one about EdgeDriver next? Or maybe a poetic pun to spice things up?

"PROMPT 4: explain what ETL means in simple words","RESPONSE 4:
Absolutely! ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load—and here’s a simple breakdown:
🧲 Extract: Grab data from different sources (like databases, files, or websites).
🔧 Transform: Clean it up, change formats, or combine it so it makes sense.
📦 Load: Put the final data into a system where it can be used—like a database or dashboard.
Think of it like making a smoothie: you gather ingredients (extract), blend them (transform), and pour it into a glass (load). Want to see a Python example of a mini ETL flow?

"PROMPT 1: write short poetry,","RESPONSE 1:
Of course, Vivek! Here's a short one to stir the circuits and the soul:
In lines of code and silent clicks,  
The browser hums, the logic ticks.  
A scrape, a save, a loop begun—  
Automation dancing with the sun.

Yet in the pause, a verse appears,  
A whisper soft between your gears.  
Not just commands, but thoughts that fly—  
A poet's spark beneath the sky.
Want one with a twist of humor or something themed around Selenium and scraping? I’ve got plenty more where that came from.

"PROMPT 2: summarize the history of AI in 3 lines,","RESPONSE 2:
Sure! Here's a crisp 3-line summary of AI's journey:
🧠 1950s–70s: AI was born from dreams of machines that could think—logic, rules, and early neural networks laid the groundwork.
⚙️ 1980s–2000s: Expert systems rose, then fell; machine learning emerged, fueled by better data and computing power.
🚀 2010s–Today: Deep learning revolutionized AI—now it powers everything from chatbots to self-driving cars, with language models leading the charge.
Want a poetic version of that too? I can remix it for fun.

Absolutely, Vivek! Here's one tailored to your scraping soul:
Why did the Selenium script break up with the browser?  
Because it couldn’t handle the dynamic relationship! 😆
Want one with Python, DevTools, or file I/O punchlines next? I’ve got a whole debug log of jokes.

"PROMPT 4: explain what ETL means in simple words,","RESPONSE 4:
Sure thing, Vivek! Here's ETL in plain, no-jargon terms:
🔄 ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load.
Extract: Grab data from different places (like websites, databases, or files).
Transform: Clean it up, change formats, or make it useful.
Load: Put it into a final spot (like a database or spreadsheet) where it can be used.
Think of it like cooking: you gather ingredients (extract), prep and season them (transform), then serve the dish (load). Want an example with Python or scraping? I can whip one up for you.
