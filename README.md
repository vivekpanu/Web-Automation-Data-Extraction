## ✨ Features  
- Automates repetitive web tasks (search, navigation, data extraction)  
- Extracts structured data from **dynamic websites**  
- Saves data in CSV/Excel format for further use  
- Integrated with **Pandas** for preprocessing and analysis  
- Reduces manual effort and improves productivity  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Selenium WebDriver**  
- **Pandas**  
- **ChromeDriver** (via `webdriver-manager`)
